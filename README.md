 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📋 Overview

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover key factors affecting passenger survival.
Using Python libraries, we perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration.

🛠 Tools Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook

📈 What We Did
Cleaned missing values and encoded categorical data.
Explored data distributions (Age, Fare, etc.).
Visualized survival rates across Gender and Passenger Class.
Studied correlations using Heatmaps and Pairplots.
Summarized key insights from the data.

🔍 Key Findings
Females had much higher survival rates.
1st class passengers survived more than 2nd and 3rd class.
Paying a higher fare increased chances of survival.
Most passengers were aged between 20 to 40 years.
